<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Welcome to Maximus78!</strong><br />
</p>
<p class="auto-style1">You&#39;ll need to complete the following steps first to enjoy the 
full experience of Maximus78 with all of the associated artwork, manuals, help 
files, and 
screenshots.&nbsp; These steps outline the basic requirements to get started, 
please see the official documentation for more specific information on using and 
configuring Maximus78.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">If you&#39;re reading this, you&#39;ve already downloaded 
Maximus78.&nbsp; You can check for updates and for the latest version at GitHub 
Here:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/AtariusMaximus/Maximus78">
https://github.com/AtariusMaximus/Maximus78</a><br />
<br />
1. <strong>Download the A7800 Windows Package<br />
</strong><br />
Maximus78 requires the A7800 Emulator.&nbsp; Download the latest version from 
GitHub and unzip it to the folder of your choice.&nbsp; Below is a link to the 
Windows version of the emulator.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/7800-devtools/a7800/releases/download/v5.2/a7800-win-v5.2.zip">
https://github.com/7800-devtools/a7800/releases/download/v5.2/a7800-win-v5.2.zip</a><br>
<br />
2. <strong>Download the A7800 Optional Files<br />
</strong><br />
Download and unzip this package to the same root folder location as A7800.&nbsp; 
It is located on the Internet Archive at archive.org.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">This file
includes two subfolders, &quot;bios&quot; and &quot;roms&quot;, whose contents 
should be installed in the same respective subfolders in the A7800 installation 
folder.&nbsp; While optional, you will want to 
download this archive to use all of the features of Maximus78 and A7800.&nbsp; 
Note that the roms folder contains an older version of Trebor&#39;s 7800 ROM pack, 
so you&#39;ll want to dowload the latest version in the next step.
</p>
<p class="auto-style1">Note that this download package is periodically updated, 
and all versions of the A7800 Optional Files package can be viewed Here:<br />
<a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=a-7800-optional-files">Internet 
Archive Search: a-7800-optional-files</a><br />
<br />
As of this writing, below is a link to the most recent version:<br />
<a href="https://archive.org/download/a-7800-optional-files-20220628/A7800_Optional_Files_20220628.zip">
https://archive.org/download/a-7800-optional-files-20220628/A7800_Optional_Files_20220628.zip</a><br>
<br />
3. <strong>Download Trebor&#39;s 7800 ROM ProPack</strong><br />
<br />
This file
includes a comprehensive compilation of Atari 7800 Homebrews, Hacks, Demos, 
Prototypes, and all retail releases in both NTSC and PAL formats.&nbsp; You can 
safely overwrite the contents of the ROMs folder with this file if you have an 
older version of Trebor&#39;s ROM pack.
It's important to note that all of the screenshots, manuals, and box art are tied to the exact file names in Trebor's ROM Pack, it's important that you do not rename an of the ROM files for Maximus78 to function properly.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">Unzip it anywhere you&#39;d like, but I&#39;d suggest the 
roms folder in your A7800 Directory.<br />
<a href="http://7800.8bitdev.org/index.php/Trebors_7800_ROM_PROPack">
http://7800.8bitdev.org/index.php/Trebors_7800_ROM_PROPack</a><br>
<br />
4. <strong>Download the Game Information zip file (includes Manauls and Screenshots) for Maximus78.
<br />
</strong><br />
You can unzip this archive anywhere, however I would suggest creating a "gameinfo" subfolder in your main A7800 Directory.&nbsp; 
This archive is available at the same location as the official release page for 
Maximus78 on GitHub.&nbsp;
You&#39;ll need to download all of the files, they are a split archive due to the 
25MB file limit on GitHub.<br />

<br /
<br>The files includes all of the screenshots and manuals for Maximus78. The manuals archive will be periodically updated as it does not contain screenshots and/or manuals for every game in Trebor's ROM pack.<br>
<br>Note that the Game information file includes images of many of the 
instruction manuals for retail and homebrew releases, and all are displayed with 
a corresponding HTM file that is also included in the archive.&nbsp; This HTML 
file is configured to display screenshots, manuals and in some cases cartridge 
images within the application, without this archive some features of Maximus78 
will not display correctly.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">The HTM files can be easily edited from within the 
application if you&#39;d like to make changes yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The current HTM 
files are very simple and easy to edit, and simply contain links and formatting 
information to display the included manuals and screenshots.&nbsp; You can also 
create an HTM file for any game that does not currently have one.&nbsp; Simply 
create a &quot;&lt;filename&gt;.htm&quot; file in the gameinfo subdirectory, where &quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot; 
is the exact same name as the ROM. For example, if you have a game ROM named 
&quot;Dungeon Stalker (v1.42) (2015) (AtariAge).a78&quot;, name the HTML file &quot;Dungeon 
Stalker (v1.42) (2015) (AtariAge).htm&quot;.&nbsp; The HTM file can then link to and 
display any image that&#39;s placed in the gameinfo subdirectory, once edited to do 
so.<br>
<br />
5. <strong>Download the Box Art zip file for Maximus78.</strong> <br />
<br />
You can unzip this archive anywhere, however I would suggest creating a "boxart" subfolder in your main A7800 Directory.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">If you wish to add your own box art to Maximus78, it&#39;s a 
simple process.&nbsp; Simply place an image file with either a JPG or PNG 
extension in the boxart subfolder, give it the exact same name as the game ROM 
file, and it will automatically appear along with the ROM in the application.&nbsp; 
For example, if you have a game ROM named &quot;Dungeon Stalker (v1.42) (2015) 
(AtariAge).a78&quot;, name the box art file either &quot;Dungeon Stalker (v1.42) (2015) 
(AtariAge).png&quot; or &quot;Dungeon Stalker (v1.42) (2015) (AtariAge).jpg&quot; and it will 
appear automatically.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">This file includes all of the box art I have availabe for Maximus78. The 
box art archive may be periodically updated as it does not contain screenshots and/or manuals for every game in Trebor's ROM pack.<br />
